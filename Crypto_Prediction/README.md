## TODO

#### Main Model

- [x] Determine the main model to predict the price (Before 2023.04.13)

- [ ] Second (Supplementary) model (pending)

#### Implementation

*Awaiting for the data structure of sentimental analysis*

- [x] Fetch BTC data

- [ ] Fetch tweet data (pending)

- [x] Data cleaning

- [x] Model implementing

- [ ] Fine tuning

#### Fusion

Discover fusion between different machine learning algorithms

#### Combine

Predict the price using ML model combined with the sentimental analysis data of tweet

#### Optimization

Optimism the running time and accuracy

## Main model

### First Model: LSTM

The LSTM model is seen as an improved version of the RNN model. RNN cannot cope with two far apart attributes because of its single register, and this problem is called long-term dependence. LSTM, as its name suggests, has long and short term memory capacity and can solve this problem.
